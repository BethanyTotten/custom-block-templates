Custom Blocks allow developers to bring one of a kind eCommerce experiences to Tapcart apps. This could be anything from embedded media, to a fully integrated shopping experience. Following the concept of Tapcart Blocks, Custom Blocks are drag n' drop-able components that can be placed anywhere on a homepage or product detail page. They are best used when creating experiences that are unique to a particular brand or need.

## About the templates
Each folder in this repo contains the needed steps & source code to configure a template. Templates will allow you to skip the foundational steps for particular Custom Block use-cases, so tht you can focus on customizing your experience. At the very least, they are a helpful tool for learning how to approach a particular build or set of functionality.

To use one, select a template (a folder) and follow the steps outlined in the folder's README.md. The source code will be contained in the relevant files. Ultimately, a Custom Block will need to be created in the [Custom Blocks Editor](https://app.tapcart.com/custom-blocks) using the instructions from the template.
