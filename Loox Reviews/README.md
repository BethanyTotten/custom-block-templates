# Loox reviews block

## Description
The LOOX Reviews block allows you to display product reviews from your LOOX account on your Tapcart app. With this block, you can build customer trust by showcasing genuine and positive reviews from past customers.

## How this block works
The LOOX Reviews block displays product reviews from your LOOX account on your Tapcart app. It retrieves the reviews using your Shopify product ID and displays them in a clean and easy-to-read format.

1. Block uses your Shopify store handle + product ID to fetch the reviews.
2. From here, customers can read the reviews of the product
3. The content becomes scrollable, so this block should be the only item included on the page when used
