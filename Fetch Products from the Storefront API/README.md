# How to Fetch Products from the Storefront API

## Description
This template allows developers to fetch product data from the Shopify Storefront API. This template is not a complete block, and only provides the networking layer needed to get the data. Additional business logic & user interfaces will be needed to create a Custom Block.

## How this template works
1. References a Storefront Token & a Store URL
2. Specifies needed product data
3. Makes a request to the Storefront API

## Setup Instructions
> Reach out to your Tapcart rep if you have any questions while configuring this Custom Block

### 1. Create a new Custom Block
1. Start [here](https://app.tapcart.com/custom-blocks) to create a new Custom Block
2. Give it a name by clicking on 'Name your block'

### 3. Copy this template's JS over to the Custom Block Editor
1. Copy the Javascript from the [script.js](#) file in this folder, and paste it in the JS tab in the editor

### 4. Add business logic & UI
This code will need to be paired with business logic & a user interface for it to be useful. You can imagine using it to look up product info for a product ID returned from another API response- just to name one example.
